# DynamicWallpaper
macOS-style time &amp; location based dynamic wallpaper template for Wallpaper Engine. This has been forked from [yaindrop's](https://github.com/yaindrop) repo. Majority of the workings for this wallpaper are because of his amazing work! I simply added a clock to the existing code. I did this so that instead of having to use Rainmeter for a clock, I could have everything from Wallpaper Engine. This way, the clock can also show up on the screensaver. The examples below are from yaindrop.

## Examples
- [Mojave](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1545776827)

- [Solar Gradients](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1545628104)

## Usage
1. Place the wallpaper images in /img folder. Name them from 1.png to n.png in order
2. Edit the metadatas in control.js: Specify total image numbers and the images for dawn & dusk
3. Import the folder as a web wallpaper in Wallpaper Engine

## Todo (eventually)
- Possibly change the font so it looks better.
- Add options so that the clock widget can be enabled or disabled.
- Add options so the font and position of the clock widget can be altered.
